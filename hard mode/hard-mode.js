// 🦆🦆 HARD MODE - FINAL BOSS: HORSE SIZED DUCK  🦆🦆

/* 
A wild mummy duck appears in front of you. She is angry because her ducklings are missing, and she blames YOU!
She orders you to fetch all her ducklings immediately, or she will attack you with all of her horse sized strength 😱

Your mission is to:
  - Retrieve all the duckling data from an API endpoint
  - She has given you the base url, which is: https://random-d.uk/api/v2
  - However, you have to find the correct endpoint to get the ducklings!

Here are the following options:
  1. /quack
  2. /:id/duck
  3. /flapflap
  4. /list
  5. /lostducklings
*/

export async function fetchAllMyDucks() {}

/* 
Mummy Duck is NOT happy 🦆 

This time, she demands that you organise all of her ducklings according to a very specific structure based on their status codes 
using nested objects with arrays! 👀

Here’s what you must do:
  1. Fetch the correct data from the API.
  2. Sort the ducklings into five categories based on their status codes.
  3. Group the ducklings into arrays (called "images") within each category.
  4. Ensure each category is labelled with the correct status key names: 
     Informational, Success, Redirection, Client Errors, and Server Errors.
  5. Make sure these labels are formatted in camelCase for her trusted friend, Camel 🐪.

Failure to follow these strict orders will result in a direct feather to the face 💢🪶
